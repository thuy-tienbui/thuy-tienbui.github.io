title: About
---

A lifelong Californian, I grew up in Orange County and moved to the Bay Area to attend UC Berkeley and frolic among the redwoods. After graduating with a degree in Conservation and Resource Studies, I traveled down the coast to sunny Santa Barbara, where I am completing my Master of Environmental Science and Management at UCSBâ€™s Bren School. I am a passionate naturalist and ecologist, excited about collaborative land stewardship, native plants, and maps.
